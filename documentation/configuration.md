# Configuration

All properties share the common prefix `dhbw.cas.decryption.`.
This prefix will **not** be repeated in the following table.
Documentation for the properties can also be found in [
`DecryptionConfiguration`](../processor/src/main/java/de/dhbw/cas/encryption/configuration/DecryptionConfiguration.java).

| Property       | description                                                                                                                                                                         | values/ type                                                                                | required |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| key            | A path to the file containing the key to use for decryption. The file has to contain a valid hex string. Only the first line of the file is used                                    | An absolute path to a file in the file system or a relative path to a file on the classpath | yes      |
| transformation | The transformation to use. The processor registers the BouncyCastle provider. Others might need to be registered to support all possible transformations                            | A valid transformation for `Cipher.getInstance`                                             | yes      |
| key-algorithm  | The key (pair) algorithm to use. This is optional and only used when the key algorithm cannot be determined from the transformation. E.g. ECIES uses EC here                        | A valid algorithm for `KeyFactory.getInstance`/ `SecretKeySpec`                             | no       |
| iv             | The initialization vector to use. Some cryptographic algorithms may need one. In case the transformation is in GCM mode, this is treated as a value for the GCM param, oth          | A valid hex string                                                                          | no       |
| type           | The type of the selected algorithm. E.g. RSA is `ASYMMETRIC`, DESede is `SYMMETRIC`, etc.                                                                                           | One of `SYMMETRIC`, `ASYMMETRIC` and `WRAPPING` although the property is case insensitive   | yes      |
| properties     | The names of the properties to decrypt                                                                                                                                              | Comma separated list of property names. Defaults to empty                                   | no       |
| charset        | The charset to use when converting the                                                                                                                                              | A valid name for `Charset.forName(String)`. Defaults to US_ASCII                            | no       |
| enabled        | Flag to easily enable/ disable the processor. Useful for testing or local development where you don't have to encrypt your secrets                                                  | Boolean. Defaults to true                                                                   | no       |
| wrapping-key   | A path to the file containing the key to use for decryption. The file has to contain a valid hex string. Only the first line of the file is used. Should be set if type is wrapping | An absolute path to a file in the file system or a relative path to a file on the classpath | no       |
